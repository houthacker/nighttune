# Nighttune
Nighttune is a successor of [AutotuneWeb](https://github.com/MarkMpn/AutotuneWeb), and is currently in beta.

### Introduction
Nighttune runs at https://nighttune.app. All user documentation is available at the Nighttune website, and therefore this README doesn't contain these docs.

### Features
- Run autotune on your Nightscout profile
- Have the results mailed to you
- Basal smoothing using [Savitzky-Golay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter) filter
